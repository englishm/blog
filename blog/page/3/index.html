<p>Wanted:</p>

<p>A small web application that can help log plays for vinyl records to Last.fm and also report them to Twitter.</p>

<p>It would draw album data (including track length times and track numbering) from Discogs.com after the user identifies the correct album (or if they’re a member on the site, selects it from their collection.)</p>

<p>Then it would allow the user to “play” the album, one side at a time, using a timer to “scrobble” each track at the appropriate interval to Last.fm. It would offer the option to “tweet” the play of the album to Twitter with a link to its Discogs entry. It would pause at the end of each side and wait for the user to flip the record and press play before beginning to “scrobble” the tracks on the next side.</p>

<p>Accurate track duration data is essential to the proper functioning of this application.  If Discogs does not have the necessary data, it might be possible to retrieve it from the MusicBrainz database.</p>

<p>If anyone would be so kind as to help me out with this, it would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Sorry, everyone. I had really hoped to keep this updated more often, but this semester has turned out to be a rather busy one. I’d like to write something about trust, privacy, and activity streams, but I just haven’t had time to read up on the latest developments. Would anyone care to explain foaf ssl to me?</p>

<p>Also, when I have time I’m going to be changing some things with the blog to clean it up and make it run a little better. Consider this a heads-up that <em>change</em> is ahead.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with a nod to Chris Saad’s <a href="http://blog.dataportability.org/index.php/2009/01/forget-open-standards/">post about Peered Data Portability.</a></p>

<p>I really like this graph:</p>

<p>In response to <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/michael-arrington" title="Michael Arrington Profile">Michael Arrington</a>‘s post, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/24/the-meaning-of-friendship/" title="The Meaning Of Friendship">The Meaning Of Friendship</a>.</p>

<p>Bucketing and “fake following” are good enough for now.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Most of this social data will be public soon because managing changing relationship is a <em>huge</em> time-sink, and the benefits of carefully managed privacy just aren’t worth the efforts. I already have to think of it this way – as if all my social data were potentially public – just because I can’t mentally juggle which bits of my data I’m give to whom. (The users most affected by increasingly public social data are the popular users who receive a lot of attention. But they’re also in the best position to deal with potential problems because they can call on their ‘tribe’ to self-manage aberrant behavior.)</p>

<p>There are a number of problems with trying to manage relationships online as if they were analog equivalents to real life relationships. One problem has to do with two things, presence, and the persistence of data.</p>

<p>In real life, as Arrington points out,<br/>
“when you don’t want to be friends with someone, you just find ways not to spend time with them.”</p>

<p>This isn’t only true in a binary sense, but actually applies to how we manage all of our relationships. All relationships are constantly in a state of flux. You’re never just ‘friends’ or ‘not friends’ with anyone. The degree and nature of our relationships has a lot to do with how and when we spend time with people.</p>

<p>In the real world relationships are built up by when the two people spend quality time with each other and relationships can wane when people are apart. In the real world, these events are always symmetric. Online, this isn’t always the case.</p>

<p>Online, someone can read your profile data, or your blog, or your activity streams when you’re not there. Depending on what information you’re sharing, this could be like leaving a copy of your journal or diary at every single one of your friends houses.</p>

<p>Getting away from privacy paranoia, say we’ve already accepted that all of our social data may as well be public, one remaining problem is that this exchange is not equivalent to symmetric relationship building in the real world. It’s difficult to gauge online, without the subtleties of body language &amp;c, the exact nature of our developing relationships. When the data exchange is inherently asymmetric, we may find a lot of people far more interested in us then we are in them. ( = problematic.)</p>

<p>In real life, for the most part, data about us is present when and where we are present. Outside of that it’s only present in our friends’ memories, and perhaps though gossip. Online, our social data is like everything else on the web, persistent. Every exchange is potentially immortalized in a log somewhere, and it’s quite acceptable to leave “wall posts” up forever. The social data is persistent, and this changes things.</p>

<p>Additionally, our relationships aren’t only determined by the <em>amount</em> of time we spend with other people, but how we spend it. Besides the quantitative aspect, there is a very important qualitative aspect to social interaction.</p>

<p>To put it in terms of data, we don’t exchange the same subset of our personal data with everyone. Every relationship is unique, because every person is unique and has slightly different interests. Within certain groups some general subset of data may be more relevant, but our relationship with one member of the group is still not identical with our relationship with every other member of the group; each relationship is unique, qualitatively and quantitatively. Even if the quantitative aspect is nearly identical (maybe you go bowling with the same group every Tuesday and you don’t see any of them outside of bowling,) still we couldn’t say that our relationship with every member of the group is identical. (You wouldn’t potentially ask Bob out on a date, but you might ask Mary out sometime.)</p>

<p>To mimic all of these nuances of relationships in both their quantitative and qualitative aspects would require extremely complex granular controls. It would be a huge time sink to manage manually, but I also wouldn’t begin to think I cold trust a computer to do it for me – at least any time soon.</p>

<p>Instead, I find it better to simply recognize that being “friended” on Facebook is not equivalent to being friends in real life. You can say that I’m “Facebook friends” with <a href="http://scobleizer.com/" title="Scobleizer — Tech geek blogger ">Robert Scoble</a>, but that doesn’t tell you what our relationship is beyond the most basic level of trust. For example, I’d be out of place offering an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/22/im-sorry-robert-but-its-time-for-a-friendfeed-intervention/" title="I’m Sorry Robert, But It’s Time For A Friendfeed Intervention">intervention</a> for his <a href="http://friendfeed.com/" title="FriendFeed">FriendFeed</a> addiction – I don’t know him that well. <img src="http://mikeenglish.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" /></p>

<p>Merry Christmas, everyone!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Following up on the <a href="http://friendfeed.com/" title="FriendFeed">FriendFeed</a> discussion from <a href="http://scobleizer.com/" title="Scobleizer — Tech geek blogger ">Robert Scoble</a>‘s <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/aad64032-6494-4e33-bc3c-fc1f88a83650/Susan-Beebe-likes-me-a-lot/" title="Susan Beebe likes me a lot - FriendFeed">post</a>, some interesting questions were raised.</p>

<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/susanbeebe" title="Susan &quot;Santa&quot; Beebe">Susan</a> mentioned that Robert was acting as “bionic human socnet filter” after which I asked if we were all becoming part of a social super brain. The discussion turned to the segmentation of the social web with <a href="http://friendfeed.com/georgegsmithjr" title="George Smith - FriendFeed">George Smith</a> commenting that:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Birds of a feather flock together. And sometimes it’s people with polar opposite views arguing. But I don’t think one place really has a large enough spectrum of human discourse…yet. We have to remember there is still a large portion of the population that does not participate in these conversations.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The web is often hailed as great boon for democracy and learning with freedom of information and global interconnectedness, but I think George makes a good point. The social web is, and tends to be segmented because that’s simply how people are tending to react to the capabilities of the Internet as a new communication medium.</p>

<p>So what brings people together?</p>

<p>A group of individuals is not a group at all unless they have something in common. People are brought together either under the leadership of an individual (as in <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/" title="Seth Godin: Author, Agent of Change">Seth Godin</a>‘s <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/tribesbook" title="A new book by Seth Godin: TRIBES">Tribes</a>) or by a shared interest in some <em>thing</em> (as in <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/" title="gapingvoid: &quot;cartoons drawn on the back of business cards&quot;">Hugh MacLeod</a>‘s <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004390.html" title="gapingvoid: &quot;cartoons drawn on the back of business cards&quot; : social objects for beginners">Social Objects</a>)</p>

<p>It shouldn’t have to be said, but most of the users of new web services share a common interest in… new web services – as well as technology in general. Therefore it follows that the conversation on these new social platforms is dominated by technology-related topics. (The other group I’ve found to have a strong presence are marketers. The so-called “<a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004740.html" title="gapingvoid: &quot;cartoons drawn on the back of business cards&quot; : sexy sms">Social Media Specialists</a>” range from genuinely helpful, intelligent people to the spammy, hapless victims of pyramid-scheme, get-rich-quick thinking, and due to the sheer volume of the SMS crowd it can be hard to sort the wheat from the chaff. I digress.)</p>

<p>Should we be offended that the <strong>only </strong>people talking on <a href="http://twitter.com/" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> are Twitter users? No.</p>

<p>I also don’t think that we should be concerned that FriendFeed is mostly populated by tech-junkies.</p>

<p>Rather than bemoan the fact that FriendFeed is cliquey and may never become “mainstream,” why not envision a forum where a ‘large enough spectrum of human discourse’ <em>is</em> represented? Articulate that <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004689.html" title="gapingvoid: &quot;cartoons drawn on the back of business cards&quot; : &quot;the purpose-idea&quot;: ten questions for mark earls">Purpose Idea</a> as a Social Object and you’ll create the community you’re looking for.  And if you happen to be doing this in the context of a startup when technology makes the next leap forward in features, (with the help of the right SMS and marketing gurus) you just might have the “next big thing.”</p>

<p>But whether it’s FriendFeed or it’s some other company that’s there to capitalize on this is hardly relevant to me as a user. I count myself as part of the mob demanding our social data be “free” and “open” and “portable” and I think that with a <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html" title="Time's (2006) Person of the Year: You">user-centric Web 2.0 paradigm</a>, we’ll get what we want.</p>

<p>The real question now is, what social object can bring together the most diverse cross-section of the population and get them talking to each other? What are the ideas that all mankind takes interest in? To what degree can we fight the inevitable segmentation and inequality caused by phenomena like <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html" title="Shirky: Power Laws, Weblogs, and Inequality?">Power Laws</a>?</p>

<p>While technology will ultimately facilitate solutions to these problems, I don’t think its scope of knowledge is sufficient to fully answer them. Before we can begin building the right tools or networks, I think we need to frame these questions philosophically, sociologically, and most importantly anthropologically. If we don’t look carefully at the impact of this technology on the human person, it’s likely that the freedom offered by these new technologies will cause the ‘global village’ to <em>degrade</em> and <em>disintegrate</em> into pockets of micro-villages, segmenting the population <em>even further</em>. Instead of bringing people together, the Internet could easily lead to increased <a href="http://www.adl.org/internet/extremism_rw/before.asp" title="ADL: The Consequences of Right-Wing Extremism on the Internet">extremism</a> and <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep98/isolat.html" title="APA Monitor: VOLUME 29 , NUMBER 9 -September 1998  Isolation increases with Internet use">isolation</a>.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.josephsmarr.com/" title="Joseph Smarr">Joseph</a>, <a href="http://www.davidrecordon.com/" title="David Recordon">David</a>, and <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/" title="Chris Messina">Chris</a> were all traveling this week, <a href="http://thesocialweb.tv/" title="TheSocialWeb.tv">TheSocialWeb.tv</a> <a href="http://www.thesocialweb.tv/blog/2008/12/test.html" title="TheSocialWeb.tv: Special Episode: &quot;Open Love from Le Web&quot;">posted video</a> from <a href="http://www.lewebparis.com/" title="LeWeb'08">Le Web</a> as this week’s episode.</p>

<p><a href="http://davemorin.com/" title="Dave Morin - Welcome to davemorin.com">Dave Morin</a> does an excellent job highlighting the value of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>‘s social graph data. – Real names, real friends, etc. as I <a href="http://mikeenglish.net/blog/2008/12/09/why-facebook/" title="Mike English dot Net » why facebook?">pointed out the other day</a>.</p>

<p>But I also think <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/" title="TechCrunch">Michael Arrington</a> raises an interesting point when he says that Facebook is not actually interested in being open. He goes on to say that “open” doesn’t always win, but is actually what the weaker competitors do when they band together to compete. I agree that it may not be in Facebook’s best interest to adopt the standards of the open stack at this point, but is openness really a sign of weakness? Or could it be rather a sign of strength when a social network adopts an open attitude – a sign of confidence in their network, and the commitment of their users to the community that their network provides? Is Facebook worried that being more “open” will degrade the value of the social graph data they’ve hoarded? Are things like <a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect/" title="Google Friend Connect: Add social features to your site">Friend Connect</a>, <a href="http://developer.myspace.com/Community/blogs/devteam/archive/2008/12/09/introducing-the-myspace-open-platform-and-myspaceid.aspx" title="Introducing the MySpace Open Platform and MySpaceID">MySpaceID</a>, and <a href="http://www.opensocial.org/" title="Home (OpenSocial.org)">OpenSocial</a> enough to force Facebook to adopt standards like <a href="http://openid.net/" title="OpenID is a free and easy way to use a single digital identity across the Internet">OpenID</a> and <a href="http://oauth.net/" title="OAuth — An open protocol to allow secure API authorization in a simple and standard method from desktop and web applications.">OAuth</a>?</p>

<p>Much as I generally dislike the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> community, I’m really excited by <a href="http://www.8bitkid.com/" title="Max Engel - the 8BitKid">Max Engel</a>‘s enthusiasm about the open stack. If MySpace continues with its commitment to “open” ideas, a lot of users stand to benefit.</p>

<p>The biggest problem for “open” as I see it, is not having a place to control your identity that is both <strong>independent</strong> and <strong>centralized</strong>. A lot of sites are implementing bits and pieces of the open stack, but as far as I’ve seen, only a few of the large existing networks are trying to implement the whole thing. If I’m going to connect the dots between my accounts across the web and tie them all to one source for my profile information, I don’t want that source to be under someone else’s control. I don’t want my Facebook profile to be the definitive ‘me’ on the web, and I definitely don’t want it to be my MySpace page. I’m glad that we’re starting to have more freedom to choose, with a growing list of OpenID providers and all, but I still don’t see a comprehensive solution that works for me. I want complete independent and centralized control of my identity.</p>

<p>What makes <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> so important? It seems that conversations about social networks always circle back to Facebook somehow. Why?</p>

<p>Well, I see a few reasons for this. First, Facebook has what is probably the most valuable social graph data. Accurate names and profiles are maintained by most of the users. I speculate that by slowly rolling out the service among colleges, and focusing on being a <strong>social utility</strong>, Facebook encouraged this social behavior. They didn’t add too many features or too many users too fast. As new users joined the network they copied the behavior of the earlier adopters, which was to provide accurate data.</p>

<p>But accuracy isn’t everything. You can find accurate profiles on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" title="LinkedIn: Relationships Matter">LinkedIn</a> for example, but LinkedIn doesn’t have the reach Facebook does. Facebook has penetrated the social networking market especially among college students (the original target audience) to such an extent that it is treated as a given, a ubiquitous utility, the way <a href="http://www.google.com" title="Google">Google</a> is treated for search. Facebook has entered the college student’s vernacular lexicon as a verb.</p>

<p>This is why Facebook is important. Not just because it’s done such a great job perfecting the social UX, – a vast improvement over <a href="http://www.myspace.com" title="MySpace">MySpace</a>‘s earlier efforts – but because ‘everyone you know’ is on Facebook, maintaining fairly accurate profiles.</p>

<p>Online, our identity is a composite representation of who we are. If we google our names or screen names, we are presented with a wealth of publicly available information about ourselves.  The tracks we leave online are indelible, so the quantity of this information will only grow as we continue to interact with various web services. What do all these bits and pieces of data say about us?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com" title="Google">Google</a>‘s great success was in pinpointing the value of organizing information. Organization, especially providing context, adds a great deal of value to information. (The data is out there already, and if it isn’t, it will be soon. The trick is in finding it, and making sense of it.) In a similar way, we need to provide value-added information about ourselves; we need to look at what’s out there and organize it for people in a way that makes sense. In doing so, we become the recognized as the rightful authority about our identity online.</p>

<p>If we want to have any sense of identity online, we need to put all of the data about us in context. If we don’t provide this context and tell the world who we are, we risk being a lost statistic,  being defined by someone else, or only being partially defined by any random cross section of data coming up in a search which could skew perspectives of who we are or what we’re about. This is where having control of our data is important, because it’s essential that we become the primary source for information about ourselves. How do we do that?</p>

<p>This is where things get a little strange. The democratization of information on the web creates quite a bit of noise. Somehow, we have to make ourselves heard above all the noise. We need to find ways to connect with the right people. (The right people are the ones with which we stand to form meaningful relationships.) We need to set ourselves apart from the crowd and highlight what makes us unique, interesting, and worth someone’s attention. Making the most of what the Internet can offer becomes then, a sort of fame-game, where all the players are minor celebrities doing their best to manage their image while still <strong>being authentic</strong>. A variety of techniques for doing this have been suggested; Chris Brogan for example, offers a <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/free-ebook-on-personal-branding/" title="Free eBook on Personal Branding | chrisbrogan.com">Free eBook on Personal Branding</a>. I think Hugh Macleod sums it up best when he writes about the <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001976.html" title="The Global Microbrand Rant">Global Microbrand</a> as the “ticket off the treadmill.” But I would go further; the personal microbrand strategy doesn’t need to have a commercial payoff (book deal, speaking gigs, etc.) to be of value to bloggers. Having any degree of name recognition raises your chances of connecting with the right people. Visibility adds value.</p>

<p>Is it an egotistical excercise to think of identity in this way? Maybe it can be. But, at the same time, I think it’s a realistic first step if your goal is to maximize your chances of building meaningful relationships online.</p>

<p>Taking as a given that our old concept of personal privacy is an illusion as <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2006/01/24/pry-to/" title="Pry, To | FactoryCity">Chris Messina does</a>, we come to conclusions that are counter-intuitive to older generations. To re-establish the protection and safety that privacy may have afforded us before the advent of the digital information age, perhaps we ought to fight not for our right to privacy, but for our right to be anything but private. We ought to fight for our right to be heard. Complete transparency, the very opposite of privacy, is the unlikely savior of our freedom.</p>

<p>Complete transparency is only useful however, if one can <a href="http://blog.particls.com/index.php/2006/04/am-i-being-heard/" title="Am I being heard?">be heard</a> above the din. If we are able to be heard, and if we are able to forge <a href="http://spatiallyrelevant.org/2008/04/07/social-evolution-developing-trust-and-relationships/" title="Social Evolution: Access &amp; Developing Relationships">meaningful relationships</a> with others online, we are afforded protection by the fact that <em>somebody cares</em>, <em>somebody notices</em>, and somebody is there to <strong>hear our complaint</strong> if we feel any entity is encroaching on our freedom or treating us unfairly. On the Internet, there really is power in numbers, with the rapid and ubiquitous spread of information even <a href="http://freereverie.org/neticulum/?p=13" title="ready or not, here everybody comes">challenging the usefulness of permanent hierarchical models of organization</a>. As mankind, are we ready for this new global democracy? As individuals, are we ready to <strong>live publicly</strong>?</p>
