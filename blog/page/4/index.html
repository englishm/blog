<p>(Here come the questions…)</p>

<p><em>What are the essential elements of a profile page?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>your name</li>
<li>your contact information</li>
<li>a picture or avatar</li>
<li>some kind of bio, or a few self-descriptive words</li>
<li>what else?</li>
</ul>


<p><em>What contact information should be included on a profile page?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>e-mail</li>
<li>twitter</li>
<li>instant messaging</li>
<li>phone?</li>
</ul>


<p>Eventually these questions become more about privacy than accessibility.</p>

<p><em>But what does privacy mean on the open web?</em></p>

<p>With the advent of social networking websites, and especially since the increased popularity of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> we’ve grown accustomed to <strong>living publicly.</strong> We no longer think twice about updating Twitter or our Facebook status to let the entire world know where we are, or what we’re doing. Why?</p>

<p>Part of this has to do, I think, with knowing that this information is of interest to our own existing social groups. It’s nice to know what your friends are up to. On the other hand, are we at greater risk by exposing this information? By using services like <a href="http://brightkite.com/" title="brightkite.com">brightkite</a> or <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/" title="DOPPLR">Dopplr</a> are we simply asking to be kidnapped, or to have our houses looted in our absence?</p>

<p>In my personal experience, doubts about these new web-ventures have usually been dismissed as old-fashioned and out of place. There’s a new paradigm, we’re working toward a new reality, and these old fears need to be set aside on the frontier of innovation.</p>

<p>The new reality, as I see it, is one where technology <strong>works for people</strong>.  The new social web is one where our virtual interactions begin to mimic the subtleties of ‘<em>real life</em>‘ social interaction. But there are a lot of difficulties in manifesting this vision. At the forefront is the problem of privacy. In real life you don’t go to great lengths to <strong>hide</strong> information about yourself, but you don’t rattle off everything you’ve ever done the first second you meet someone either. In real life we get to know people gradually; we become acquainted with them over time and more intimate channels of communication may or may not be opened.</p>

<p>If you strike up a conversation with someone in a coffeehouse for example, you don’t give them your home phone, mobile phone, mailing address, weekly schedule, favorite books, favorite movies, and who knows what else in the first five minutes of conversation, and before you get to know them as a person. But this is how it works on the web right now, it’s usually all or nothing, because we treat profiles like business cards. Not that this isn’t useful, but for the average user, it becomes difficult to decide what information to share.</p>

<p>The other thing about real life information sharing is that it is almost always managed subconsiously on an <strong>individual basis</strong>. We think about our relationship with each person we interact with, and they often don’t fall into clear-cut categories. The categorical model of relationships assumption that most social websites with privacy controls make is inadequate.</p>

<p>Mimicking the safety of this individual and gradual sharing of information is difficult on the web. On the web, we like everything to be automatic and ready to go. We don’t want to spend our time managing our information, we want to spend it actually being social. It’s easier to build in levels of privacy to a closed, centralized network like Facebook. But on the open web, lack of universal standards makes managing privacy a dauntingly time-consuming task. Is it worth the effort? How badly do we need our privacy? How do we think about privacy on the open web? Are our models analogous to real world social interaction? Can they be?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Chris Saad points out that <a href="http://chrissaad.wordpress.com/2008/11/20/dealing-with-data-portability-privacy-issues/">“traditional ideas of privacy are changing.”</a> Are these changes a natural evolution, or are they sparked by the inability of the Internet’s global interconnectedness, the “global village” model, to mimic traditional social relations?  If the later, and if we treat this effect of technology on our lives as acceptable, the Internet potentially stands to have a larger cultural impact than I think anyone yet expects.</p>

<p>The term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earworm" title="Earworm - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"><strong>earworm</strong></a>, referring to a song that’s stuck in your head, tends to carry a negative connotation. Often times however, it’s my favorite songs that get stuck in my head. Not always – it’s still possible to have an annoying jingle torment me for hours, – but usually the songs that pop into my head out of the blue and stick with me are tunes I rather enjoy.</p>

<p>I’d like to start sharing these gems as they come to me, but I’m still trying to decide the best way to do it. (As with most things.) I’d like to standardize it and make it more machine-readable so it can provide more useful information in the future.</p>

<p>I think that to post an earworm you ought to at least have the fields of Artist, and Song, but I’d also like to include an optional link to the <a href="http://www.last.fm/" title="Last.fm - The Social Music Revolution">Last.fm</a> page for the song, as well as an optional quotation of the repeating lyrical phrase.</p>

<p>Today, I used <a href="http://friendfeed.com/" title="FriendFeed">FriendFeed</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> to assemble such information about <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/9842cfdc-fc42-4f1e-b194-eaffbee8da58/earworm-Elvis-Costello-Goon-Squad/" title="Elvis Costello - Goon Squad">this earworm</a>. Is this the best way? Could this be streamlined or automated? Is there any interest in an earworm activity spec?</p>

<p>What does identity mean online?</p>

<p>In the past, the most important moniker for online identity was your e-mail address. This is changing.  Identity is increasingly being defined not by e-mail address, but by URL. It doesn’t matter anymore where your mailbox is, but what property you actually inhabit on the web.</p>

<p>If you can prove you control a URL, then you have an identity you can use across the web. <a href="http://openid.net/" title="OpenID is a free and easy way to use a single digital identity across the Internet">OpenID</a> is the new definitive standard for exactly this. It’s a sort of handshake for verifying ownership of these online properties.</p>

<p>If you hadn’t already noticed, this blog is OpenID enabled. That means that anyone with an OpenID can easily leave a comment, automatically including whatever identifying information they’ve set their provider to pass along. It also means that I can use this blog as an OpenID. When the Internet asks, “Who are you?” I can respond, “I’m http://mikeenglish.net/blog/, nice to make your acquaintance.” – only, is that best representation of who I am?</p>

<p>A URL provides two forms of information, first, the semantic information that may or may not exist in the URL itself, and second, the content available at the URL. Populating and configuring this blog will constitute the second half of that information, but what about the first part, what does it mean to be http://mikeenglish.net/blog/?</p>

<p>Why not just http://mikeenglish.net? In fact, I’ve already starting using http://mikeenglish.net as an OpenID. It’s simple and straightforward. Right now visiting that URL brings you a page with my name on it. I recently made it a hyperlink, and it links to this blog.</p>

<p>Why didn’t I install wordpress to the root of the domain, why does this blog live at /blog? Maybe it’s because I’m not sure what this will become, I’m not sure I’m ready to be so directly identified with something that’s still experimental, something that’s still evolving and growing. And yet, providing a home for my online identity is exactly why I’ve created this blog. Perhaps then, the relegating of this content to /blog should be taken as a gesture that the development of my online identity is still in early beta.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Part of my goal with this blog is to create a real home for my online identity. If you’ve known me for very long you’ve probably watched me move from one URL to the next like a hermit crab outgrowing shells. I’ve grown tired of moving from one network to the next without anyplace to really hang my hat. My solution is to attempt building myself this space.</p>

<p>What I’d like is something akin to what Facebook is becoming, but open. (more on that later, as I continue to figure out what exactly it is I want this to be)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>An interesting thing happened this evening; I re-discovered the <a href="http://diso-project.org/" title="Open, distributed, social">DiSo project</a>, but I learned much more about it this time than I had in the past. What I found is that to really learn what the project was doing, I had to learn who exactly was working on it.</p>

<p>I’ve grown so accustomed to the old media of broadcasting, that I first assumed if I found the project website, I’d learn everything I needed to know. Instead, I was surprised to find that there was much more information distributed across various blogs and social networks than there was in any one centralized location. I was forced to look at the project as the work of <strong>people</strong>.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s fitting that DiSo would operate in this fashion.  It gives me a lot of hope that the new forms of social media are going to put people back in control of technology and bring online social interaction back in touch with authentic personhood.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This is the hope that goes in to building this home.</p>

<p><em>Why am I starting this blog now? Why start a blog at all? Aren’t there enough already?</em></p>

<p>If my goal was to jump right to the top of the “A-list” heap, starting a blog like this would be the wrong way to do it. But that’s not my goal, not at this point. Right now my goal for this space is more personal than that. I’m exploring what online identity means to me, and I’m creating balance in my life.</p>

<p><em>Balance? What does tinkering around with blogging and computers have to do with balance?</em></p>

<p>Easy, it’s my perfect hobby. The last time I really got down to the nuts and bolts of tinkering with something technical was back in highschool when the coolest (geeky) thing I could think to do was dual-booting my self-built PC and compiling unstable gentoo linux kernels with patches for devices most people didn’t have working yet. It made me happy.</p>

<p>Now I’m a fourth year undergraduate student studying theology at a small Midwestern Catholic university who finds most of his free-time spent reading and pondering philosophical dilemmas. While I find this immensely interesting, most of these philosophical dilemmas are as old as time, so pondering them for very long isn’t very satisfying – in fact, it can be downright depressing.</p>

<p>Working on a website like this offers me an opportunity to redirect my excess brainpower toward an activity that will hopefully provide some mild sense of satisfaction.</p>

<p>So here I am, rediscovering my predilection for technogeekery, and exploring new dimensions of self. I couldn’t be happier.</p>
